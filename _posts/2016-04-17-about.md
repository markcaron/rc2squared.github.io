This is one guy's adventure in teaching himself to code. I plan to write about
various things I learn. My posts may be about programming, system or network
administration, or random things that I pick up along the way.

When it comes to programming, the amount of information and choice is
overwhelming. So, I decided to pick a language and start with that. I chose Ruby.

I began with a few books - [_Learn Ruby the Hard Way_](http://learnrubythehardway.org/book/),
[_The Well-Grounded Rubyist_](https://www.amazon.ca/Well-Grounded-Rubyist-David-Black/dp/1617291692/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1460940945&sr=1-1),
and [_Ruby on Rails Tutorial_](https://www.railstutorial.org/book). And I have
a long way to go. With some practice and an insane amount of luck, we'll
see some improvement.
